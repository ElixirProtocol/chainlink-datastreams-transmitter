# Chainlink Data Streams Broadcaster

## Overview

Chainlink Data Streams Broadcaster is a service that bridges off-chain data streams with on-chain smart contracts. It continuously monitors off-chain price updates and pushes them on-chain based on predefined conditions such as price deviations or time intervals.

### Key Features:

- Retrieves and verifies price data from Chainlink Data Streams.
- Writes verified prices to on-chain smart contracts.
- Supports containerized deployment with Docker.
- Configurable through environment variables and Redis-based settings.

## Environment Variables

To make setting environment variables easier there is a `.env.example` file in the root folder of this project. You can copy it to a new `.env` file and replace the values with your own.

| Name                        | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD`            | Required for the local persistance layer operation. If not provided the setup will fallback to the default Redis password.                    |
| `PRIVATE_KEY`               | Used to make payments in LINK for the Data Streams verifications on-chain and for writing data on-chain on the user provided custom contract. |
| `DATASTREAMS_HOSTNAME`      | Chainlink Data Streams Hostname.                                                                                                              |
| `DATASTREAMS_WS_HOSTNAME`   | WebSocket Hostname for Data Streams.                                                                                                          |
| `DATASTREAMS_CLIENT_ID`     | Client ID for authentication.                                                                                                                 |
| `DATASTREAMS_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client Secret for authentication.                                                                                                             |  |

> [!NOTE]
> All other user configurations are stored locally using Redis file eliminating the need for separate configuration files. This ensures fast access and persistence across sessions without manual file handling. Only sensitive configurations, such as API keys and database credentials, are managed separately in the `.env` file. The application automatically loads and updates configurations in Redis as needed. Users do not need to manually edit or maintain configuration files, simplifying setup and deployment.
> 
> Optional: The initial configurations can also be seeded by providing a `config.yml` file. See the `config-example.yml` and section below for more details.

---

## YAML Configuration Setup

Although configurations are stored in Redis, an example YAML configuration is provided for reference. This YAML file can be used to seed the Redis configuration parameters automatically without requiring manual input through the UI. This approach simplifies setup and allows for easier reproducibility of configurations across multiple instances of the service.

Using a YAML file for configuration also makes it possible to replicate a specific setup by copying the file across different instances of the Broadcaster. This ensures that deployments remain consistent and eliminates the need for repeated manual configuration when scaling the service.

### YAML Configuration

```yaml
# List of Chainlink Data feeds that the broadcaster will subscribe to
feeds:
  # Name of the feed

---

## Deployment Guide

The entire application is containerized and is designed to be run using the provided `docker-compose` setup. This ensures a seamless environment by automatically managing all required services, including the local Redis database, WebSocket listeners, logging, verification services, and the frontend management application. Running `docker compose up` will spin up all necessary containers with minimal setup. This approach simplifies deployment, ensures consistency across environments, and reduces configuration overhead. For production use, consider customizing the `docker-composÐµ.yml` file or extending the setup as needed.

Before starting the application, ensure that all necessary environment variables are set in the `.env` file. Missing variables may cause services to fail or behave unexpectedly.

### Running with Docker Compose

1. Ensure the `.env` file is present and you've added the necessary environment variables.
2. Start the service:
   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```
3. To stop the service:
   ```sh
   docker compose down
   ```

### Production Deployment

- Modify `docker-compose.yml` to set up persistent storage and environment variables.
- If the service is going to be accessible externally consider running it behind a reverse proxy like Nginx.

---

## UI Setup Instructions

The Broadcaster provides a UI for managing feeds. It is automatically enabled if you start the broadcaster using the Docker compose file as mentioned in the instructions above.

To start it manually outside of the docker setup:

1. Start the UI service using:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Access it via `http://localhost:3000`.

> [!NOTE]
> The UI requires a running Redis instance. Make sure a Redis instance is running and the authentication credentials are set in the `.env` file when running the UI outside of the containerized setup in the docker configuration.

---

## Logging

The application supports different logging levels:

- **INFO**: General system status.
- **DEBUG**: Detailed debugging output.
- **ERROR**: Critical failures.

Logs can be accessed via:

```sh
docker logs -f broadcaster
```

The application stores logs in the `logs` directory to maintain an audit trail of user actions and configuration changes. They can also be used for troubleshooting..

---

## Testing Commands

After deployment, verify the setup with:

- Verify logs:
  ```sh
  docker logs broadcaster
  ```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Fixes

- **Service not starting?**
  - Ensure `.env` file is correctly configured.
  - Run `docker compose logs` for errors.
- **Data not updating?**
  - Verify the RPC endpoint.
  - Check Redis for correct configurations.
- **Authentication failures?**
  - Ensure `DATASTREAMS_CLIENT_ID` and `DATASTREAMS_CLIENT_SECRET` are valid.

---

## Modifications & Further Development

For development, you can either use the provided docker-compose setup or run services manually. To start the application in a containerized environment, use:

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

> [!NOTE]
> Using the `--build` flag in the above command ensures the changes you've made to the project are present in the newly built docker image.

If you prefer running the application locally, ensure that Redis is installed and running. Then, install dependencies and start the application:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Modify the `.env` file as needed for local development. Logs and debugging tools are integrated to assist with development and troubleshooting.

### Modifications

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

If you're making changes to the application, restart the affected services or use hot-reloading where supported to apply modifications efficiently.

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```
